# sphinx-bitutils

**WARNING:** This sphinx extension is still very much in beta! It might (read, will) break randomly.

This is a [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) addon that adds utilities to describe bitwise and bytewise binary structures in Sphinx without the need to resort to tables.

There is also support for [Construct](https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) objects to be automatically documented using the same utilities to provide a consistent and pretty look.
